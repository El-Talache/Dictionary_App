# Dictionary_App
This is a project I have been meaning to try out. 
Its basically a dictionary App, and We are planning to use Java for it. 
The main goal would be that you would have a file with many words with their definitions and add them to a linked list or a Map. 
It would be nice to have them, and to add them in an alphabetical order, with all their details as well. 
Additionally, you would propt the user to enter a word and we would look it up, and display the definition.

# Dictionary_App
This is a project I have been meaning to try for a while. 
Its basically a dictionary App, and We are planning to use Java for it. 
The main goal would be that you would have a file with many words with their definitions and add them to a linked list. 
It would be nice to have them, and to add them in an alphabetical order, with all their details as well. 
Additionally, you would propt the user to enter a word and we would look it up in the List of words in it, and, since it is ordered alphabetically,
we should use binary search to find the word in the linked list.
after the word is found, the definition will be displayed.
